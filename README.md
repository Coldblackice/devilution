## Devilution is deprecated. I have another Diablo project in the works so stay tuned!

I've decided to release the very first version of Devilution alongside the last. This is for all those of you out there that think reversing takes no time at all.

The first version [2018_03_14](2018_03_14) was a raw dump from IDA that had thousands of errors fixed before it finally compiled. Executable immediately crashes when ran.

The last version [2020_03_31](2020_03_31) after two years of group efforts. This is an incomplete rewrite of Devilution from 2019 by me, with improved accuracy based off the beta.

Credits to the people who helped along the way. This project was a great learning experience and helped me develop useful skills.
