The beginning and end of Devilution - Diablo reverse engineered

I've decided to release the very first version of Devilution alongside the last. This is for all those of you out there that think reversing takes no time at all.

The first version [2018_03_14](2018_03_14) was a raw dump from IDA that had thousands of errors fixed before it finally compiled. Executable immediately crashes when ran.

The last version [2020_03_31](2020_03_31) will let you see what two years of work to clean it all up resulted in. This is the latest rewrite done entirely by me, based off the beta and existing cleanups. Note that some files and functions were not cleaned up (like `players.cpp`), as I gave up on the project.

Credits to the people who also helped along the way.
